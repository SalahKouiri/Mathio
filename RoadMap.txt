ðŸ“Œ Mathio Development Roadmap
A dynamic math toolkit designed for efficient calculations, problem-solving, and algorithm experimentation.
ðŸ”¹ Version 1: Core Math Functions (Foundation)
âœ… Step 1: Arithmetic & Basic Operations
- Implement addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Handle edge cases like division by zero.
- Optimize for precision and efficiency.
âœ… Step 2: Algebraic & Logical Operations
- Support power functions (x^y), square roots, and logarithms.
- Add logical comparisons (>, <, ==).
- Introduce basic equation solving (linear equations).
âœ… Step 3: Structured Input & Output Handling
- Allow dynamic user input for calculations.
- Format results clearly for readability.
- Create a command-line interface (GUI can come later).

ðŸ”¹ Version 2: Advanced Mathematical Functions
âœ… Step 4: Matrix & Vector Operations
- Support matrix addition, multiplication, and inversion.
- Introduce vector calculations for physics/math applications.
âœ… Step 5: Trigonometry & Complex Numbers
- Implement sine, cosine, tangent functions.
- Add support for imaginary numbers (i).
- Expand logarithms to complex domain.
âœ… Step 6: Differentiation & Integration (Calculus)
- Compute basic derivatives (dy/dx).
- Add numerical integration techniques (Simpsonâ€™s Rule, Trapezoidal Method).

ðŸ”¹ Version 3: Optimization & Expansion
âœ… Step 7: Performance Enhancements & Accuracy Improvements
- Optimize algorithm execution for speed.
- Reduce floating-point precision errors.
- Cache frequently used calculations for efficiency.
âœ… Step 8: Modular System & API Integration
- Allow easy function expansion via modular plugins.
- Make Mathio adaptable for integration into other projects (API endpoints).
âœ… Step 9: Basic GUI Implementation (Optional)
- Introduce a simple interface for ease of use.
- Allow users to input functions visually instead of code-based interaction.

ðŸ”¹ Version 4+: AI-Powered Math & Research Utilities
âœ… Step 10: AI-Assisted Problem Solving
- Implement basic AI-driven equation solving.
- Generate step-by-step explanations for computations.
âœ… Step 11: Symbolic Computation & Automated Proofs
- Introduce symbolic algebra (Solving equations in terms of x).
- Experiment with basic automated theorem proving techniques.
âœ… Step 12: Advanced Machine Learning Models for Math Research
- Train AI models to suggest the best approach for solving complex problems.
- Implement a feature where Mathio recognizes patterns in formulas and optimizes solutions.
